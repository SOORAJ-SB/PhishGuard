# PhishGuard: A Web Crawling Approach for Mitigating Phishing Threats


## Overview

Welcome to PhishGuard, an advanced web application designed to identify phishing websites with a high degree of accuracy. This project employs machine learning techniques, specifically Neural Networks, to assess the legitimacy of a given URL. It is equipped with a user-friendly web portal that allows users to input a URL for real-time phishing prediction.

## Key Features

- **Effective Phishing Detection:** PhishGuard employs a carefully crafted dataset and utilizes 17 handpicked features extracted from URLs to distinguish between legitimate and phishing websites.

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** The project includes a comprehensive analysis of five different machine learning algorithms - Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Based on this analysis, Neural Network was selected for its consistency and the highest accuracy in phishing detection.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The web portal provides an intuitive interface for users to input a URL and instantly receive a prediction regarding its phishiness.

- **Detailed Accuracy Analysis:** The project includes in-depth accuracy analysis of the selected Neural Network algorithm, allowing you to understand its performance and reliability.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection and Feature Extraction:** A robust dataset is collected, and 17 relevant features are extracted from the URLs of both legitimate and phishing websites.

2. **Machine Learning Model:** The project presents an insightful comparison of various machine learning algorithms. Neural Network emerges as the best performer, and it is subsequently trained on the dataset.

3. **Web Portal Integration:** The trained Neural Network is integrated into a user-friendly web portal that allows users to input a URL. The portal then predicts whether the website is phishing or not based on the provided features.

4. **Accuracy Analysis:** The project offers detailed accuracy analysis, including metrics and visual representations, so users can assess the model's performance.
